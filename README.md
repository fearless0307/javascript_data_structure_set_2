# Data Structure Set 2
### Q.1. Remove any “unordered” elments (i.e. leave the list in non-decreasing order)
```
For example:

1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3 -> 6 -> 6 -> 10 -> 4 -> X
would become
1-> 4 -> 6 -> 6 -> 10 -> X
```
### Q.2. Given a linked list and two integers M and N. Traverse the linked list such that you retain M nodes then delete next N nodes, continue the same until end of the linked list.
```
Input:
M = 2, N = 2
Linked List: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8
Output:
Linked List: 1->2->5->6
```
### Q.3. Given a linked list and a number k. Reverse every k nodes in the list.
```
Example :

Input 1->2->3->4->5->6 and k = 2
Output 2->1->4->3->6->5
```
### Q.4. Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.
```
For example,
Given 1->2->3->4, you should return the list as 2->1->4->3.
```
### Q.5. Write a GetNth() function that takes a linked list and an integer index and returns the data value stored in the node at that index position.
```
Example:

Input:  1->10->30->14,  index = 2
Output: 30
The node at index 2 is 30 (edited) 
All questions are based on Linked List.
